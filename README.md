- Hi, I’m Mark!
- I’m interested in data science and public policy, particularly related to regulations and the US federal rulemaking process.
- Currently, I work as a senior policy analyst at the [GW Regulatory Studies Center](https://github.com/regulatorystudies).
- I primarily use Python, but I'm also proficient in R and Stata.
